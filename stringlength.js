//You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:
let answer1 = "It's alright";
let answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";
let answer3 = 'He is called "Johnny"';
console.log(answer1);
console.log(answer2);
console.log(answer3);

//To find the length of a string, use the built-in length property:
let text = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
let length =text.length;
console.log(length);
